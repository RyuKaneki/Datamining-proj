# Datamining-proj
Data Mining Course Project.
We will analyse the Amazon recommendation data set. In our analysis, we will be building a predictive model to predict the relevance of a recommenation. Our second task will be a sentiment analysis. We shall be using logistic regression and naive bayes for the sentiment analysis part.
We shall be optimizing our dataset with the knowledge of standard deviation and weighted scores assigned to certain ratings based on user behaviour.
Algortithm:
Loading dataset
Analysing the rating frequency to find any special pattern
Filtering dataframe to drop any users who have rated below a certain threshold to avoid sparcity in matrix
Analysing ratings spread over products to find any special pattern
Sorting the products by average product rating(a measure of popularity)
Making a memory based recommender system using KNNMeans library
Making a model based collaborative filtering system
Repeating the process with the optimized dataset and comparing results.
